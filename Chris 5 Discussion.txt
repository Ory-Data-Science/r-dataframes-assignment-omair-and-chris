Sourcing: when you source it should output a value without error
R-Script Editing: check for X's and typos in your R file (as marked by red underlined squigglys)

Naming Conventions: What you name a variable, should be what it is or what the function did
Line Breaks: Separating long lines into smaller chunks for easier interpretation
Grouping of Lines: Separate lines by what is being worked on, group them together
